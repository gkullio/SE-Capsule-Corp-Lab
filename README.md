This is for the Azure deployment of the Capsule Corp Lab. It includes Terraform code to deploy the necessary infrastructure in Azure, as well as a README with instructions on how to set up and run the lab.

There will be eventual additions to this lab that will include using AWS, and GCP to fully deploy this lab for a "true" multi-cloud network experience.
